// The core of GetRunningApplicationsUsingPackage: a BFS over the in-memory mount graph
// (reverse dependency walk from the locked versions of the changed package up
// to the root applications). Kept free of ralf/libpackage types so it is
// directly compilable on a PC - the gtest suite in test/ builds this exact
// translation unit (../src/RunningApplicationsUsingPackage.cpp), no mirrored copy.
